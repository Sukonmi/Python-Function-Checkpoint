# üéØOVERVIEW.
This is a Python Checkpoint that allows me to practice the skills I learnt in the python functions skill set.

# üì¢DESCRIPTION.
I created a calculator program that allows the user to perform mathematical operations on two numbers using basic functions and a dictionary to store the operations. This program would also have the ability to continue calculations with the result of previous calculations.

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è INSTRUCTIONS.

- Create four basic mathematical functions: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide' that take in two numbers and return the result of the operation.
- Create a dictionary 'operations' that assigns the functions to their corresponding operation symbols.
- Create a function 'calculator' that prompts the user to input the first number.
- Use a for loop to print the available operation symbols.
- Create a while loop that will continue to run until the user chooses to end the current calculation.
- Inside the while loop, prompt the user to select an operation symbol.
- Prompt the user to input the second number.
- Use the dictionary to retrieve the function that corresponds to the selected operation symbol and store it in a variable 'calculation_function'
- Perform the calculation by calling the 'calculation_function' on the two input numbers and store the result in a variable 'answer'.
- Print the equation and the result of the calculation.
- Ask the user if they would like to continue using the result as the first number for further calculations.
- If the user chooses to continue, update the 'num1' variable to the value of 'answer'.
- If the user chooses to start a new calculation, set the 'should_continue' variable to false and call the 'calculator' function to start a new calculation.
